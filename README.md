# Helen-Nellie Adigwe â€“ Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! I am a multidisciplinary data analyst with a background in geology, petroleum exploration, product development, and business analytics. I use Python, SQL, R, and data visualization tools to draw insights from complex datasets and apply them across health, finance, sustainability, and social impact domains.

This repository showcases selected data science projects, some of which are hosted on Medium and GitHub. Each project includes a brief summary and relevant links.
