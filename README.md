# Helen-Nellie Adigwe ‚Äì Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! I am a multidisciplinary data analyst with a background in geology, petroleum exploration, product development, and business analytics. I use Python, SQL, R, and data visualization tools to draw insights from complex datasets and apply them across health, finance, sustainability, and social impact domains.

This repository showcases selected data science projects, some of which are hosted on Medium and GitHub. Each project includes a brief summary and relevant links.

## üìä Projects Overview

### 1. [Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions](https://medium.com/@helennellieadigwe/fraud-detection-in-financial-transactions-insights-challenges-and-strategic-recommendations-65371cd1b65e)
- Built classification and clustering models to detect suspicious financial activity.
- Performed time-series analysis and visualized trends using Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib).

### 2. [Early Detection of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease](https://medium.com/@helennellieadigwe/early-detection-diagnosis-of-alzheimers-disease-applying-machine-learning-and-power-bi-in-1b72e419f2c9)
- Developed ML models to classify Alzheimer's disease from medical data.
- Created interactive dashboards using Power BI to communicate findings.

### 3. üè• Hospital ER Data Analysis (R Project)
**Folder:** [`hospital-er-analysis`](./hospital-er-analysis)

This project analyzes emergency room data to explore patient wait times, satisfaction scores, referral patterns, and demographic trends. Conducted entirely in R and exported as a PDF report.

- Script: [`The_Script.pdf`](./hospital-er-analysis/The_Script.pdf)
- Dataset: [`Hospital_ER_Data_2.csv`](./hospital-er-analysis/Hospital_ER_Data_2.csv)
- Visuals:
  - Age Distribution
  - K-Means Clustering on Wait Times
  - Wait Times by Race, Age, Referral Department
  - Correlation Matrix + Heatmaps
